### xX.1 Some Music.
Want to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conversations_with_Myself_(album)" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">listen along</a>? The third and seventh songs are my favorite. Done with that? Try <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuASFDTAFg0" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">this</a>.

### xX.2 Floating and Sinking All the Time[^1].
I think the world is neither cold and dark, nor warm and bright, nor some homogenous average of the two; instead, it is a convection cell, swirling, frothing. It is somtimes shit, and sometimes *the* shit. 

<br>

Speaking of 'homo,' I am one. I don't know why; it was kind of always that way. I've never had a crush on anyone of the *opposite* gender; I've pretended to, or many times convinced myself that I have, and even had sex with women. But there's nothing there. After the momentary novelty fades I am left with just the meaningless details—her spit is metalic, like iron, *like rust;* that I am hot but at the same time cold; that my hair is in my mouth and I wish it wasn't. And then I am left with just the motions.

<br>

Often I wish I were straight. I still honestly struggle a little just to write *"I am gay."* Just seeing it there pushes me backwards and out of my head a few inches, my eyes rushing away from those stupid little words. I am made suddenly aware of my nose sitting fat and wide in the center of my vision, and of my veiny hands splayed out across the keyboard. It feels so objectifying. For that moment I feel like I am some strange swollen, ugly creation that this trait has been carelessly tossed into, just a jumbled mess of broken fuckery. In that moment, I recall all the times I relaxed and my voice has slipped and sounded like *that*. I have done so much—for fuck's[^2] sake, I got into the best university in the United States—yet for so many the first thing they judge me by is *that*. And sometimes, I judge with them. 

<br>

A while ago, I visited my maternal grandparents and they sat me down at their uncomfortable little coffee table (the one shoved in the corner, the one that crushes my legs and makes me bend my arms fourty-five degrees from where they would otherwise rest) and asked me about "the girls in my life." A week before I had broken up, bloodily, with my boyfriend of almost two years, whom I truly—or really at least as much as you can at that age—loved dearly. I told them that I had just broken up with my "girlfriend" and that I didn't want to talk too much about it. And when I saw them most recently, I had once again recently convinced myself that I could fall for a woman and had once again entered the motions. At least that time, when they asked me questions, I didn't have to lie, quite as much. And I play the same tune for my paternal grandfather, the bigot that he is; with my paternal grandmother, I simply say nothing. I will never tell my grandparents.

<br>

I told my mother and and I told my father that I am bisexual, and I told this story to myself for a long time, too. At least that way each of them gets to live with some hope that I might not just end their bloodline, that I might not steal away their grandchildren, just to serve myself. My father has always said, "The idea I love most is being a father. But being a grandfather is a close second." I struggle to imagine telling my parents what I really am; I think for all they have done for me they deserve at least some level of that conciliatory hope, false as it is. I can see it glimering in my dad's eyes, when he sees a woman on the television, and turns around with his little coy grin, thinking that we're both sharing something. I return his simper. But I am left with just the motions.

### xX.3 The Reality of Group Rejection and Self-Actualization.
I'm actually pretty good at playing straight—to the point where it has at times scared my gay friends. In a second I can drop my voice half an octave, rain upon them an unholy storm of *"bro"*s, then dap them up with such excellent crispness that the temu-ass gaydar with which most straight men are equipped is throughly <a href="https://makeagif.com/gif/spaceballs-radar-jam-gJrmFZ" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">jammed</a>. But jam can of course with time be sponged off their instruments and eventually the incongruences make themselves visible.

<br>

 
I rowed in high school. I made some of my best, most kind friends at that program, and they valued me for who I was. I didn't have to act. And amongst my teammates I was one of the best; my relative speed, strength, and demeanor commanded respect. I was elected team captain my senior year.  Hoping for more—and truly loving the sport—I joined the crew team at the university my first freshman semester.

<br>

My experience there was different. For about the first three weeks I put on that straight mask. I chuckled along as they objectifed women and told their disturbing stories; I agreed with them as they complained about the college investigating them for misconduct. For a brief period, I was liked. I was one of them. But as more time passed, I found myself pushed to the sidelines by my convictions: *no, I would not call myself a Trump supporter in spite of your jeers; no, I would not laugh along with your antisemetic jokes; no, I would not go to your party to which only straight couples are invited; no, I would not dress up as aborted babies and go to a party; no, I would not hide my mortification when you play gay porn in the public dining hall as a 'surprise'; no, I would not wear nothing but...* I digress. Very quickly the mask had slipped off; I was unable to maintain it, and, *I did not want to.* By the time I discovered the few good things there, I had already been alienated from the group, and had honestly not cared to put up a fight.

<br>

I think that *"want"* is in fact the most important bit there. Indeed *I did not want* to be like some of them were; my force of self-actualization was stronger and would not acquiesce to the overarching force of the group. 

<br>

I still see my former teammates around campus. Very often, it is quite unpleasant; that is of course to be expected. It is human nature to dislike group rejection. And yet I am happier to be rejected then pretend to be something I am not. The more time that passes, the more certain I am that I was right to leave.

<br>

### xX.4 Would *I* Rather?
A few hours ago I was alone in my room, in my dorm, with the door shut, and one of my roomates walked into the common room with a bunch of their friends. One asked, "Would you rather be *gay* or *autistic and paralyzed*?" Without a moment's hesitation, my roomate replied, *"...of course I'd rather be autistic and paralyzed!"* After the strange hilarity of that accidental eavesdrop had passed, the actual thought began to mix rather poorly with my already upset mood, and had me wondering, *"Would I rather be gay or straight?"*

<br>

Honestly, I don't know. There's a lot about it that sucks. But I *am* gay. I can't really change that. And there's a lot of wonderful things that come from that, too. Am I proud of, or happy with my sexuality? No, not in and of itself, but I think I *am* proud of *myself*, and my sexuality is, has been, and always will be an indelible part of that.

<br>

I think I'll end on something an also-gay friend said to me at dinner the other day: "Ever since I came out, my mother keeps texting me about interior design. And, like, I feel like I should be in some way offended, but it *does* come really easily to me."
