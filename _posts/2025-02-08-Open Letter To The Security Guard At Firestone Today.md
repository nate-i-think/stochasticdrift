To the security guard, at the bag check at Firestone Library, whose name I should but likely will never know--

When you complimented my jacket today, with a genuine smile, a smile that says that this was a compliment not doled out like it was nothing, given instead from a place of geniune appreciation, I remembered. And I knew you did too.

<br>I remembered when a few weeks ago you complimented my hair, and I remembered how we talked, for no more than fourty-five seconds, about how you "...don't have the guts..." to grow it out like I did, after which I complimented your tatoos, which I could barely see, but which you took as quite geniune, and smiled that same smile from today, and then we said goodbye and I left.

<br>And I knew today, retrospectively, as the knowledge smoldered and then burned, an inferno searing my back as I walked away and out the lobby doors, that you had expected me to have returned today's compliment, at least somewhat, and that I had not, even though, had I taken a second more with my bag, I could have found something. And that it was a small, but geniune disappointment.

<br>And as I listened to *Lucky To Be Me* on the way down the hill I resolved that should the opportunity present itself, I would have to make amends, in some manner.

<br>How very similar we all are, yet how very separated we find ourselves.
