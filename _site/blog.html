      <h2><a href="/2025/02/05/It-Hit-Me-at-Terrace.html">It Hit Me at Terrace</a></h2>
      <p>A few days ago, Saturday, I could be seen Terrace, crossed beyond recognition of course—as you should be at Terrace—stumbling my way downstairs, when I was struck in the head. I struck in the head with one of those fleeting but indelible moments of illumination, those peeks into something more profoud then baseline awareness, like Teresa-of-Ávila-esque was, which I had to mention because I’m a pretentious fuck. My head split open in searing and abject pain, but it was not corporeal, no; the tragedy and the terrible horror of the truly ephemeral nature of that moment was washing across me: <em>this moment will never, it could never, it would never</em> be recovered or relived exactly and would only remembered in a decaying, shitty, and infinitely incomplete picture in the drunken recesses of my brain, a photocopy of a photocopy of an already blurry polariod, that my conciousness in that moment could not be captured, and so I would die with it, and in the time that come to this conclusion, that I had already died a hundred times.</p>

      <p>My grandfather sits asleep, well, not quite asleep; you can tell by the way he shifts in his chair, gently stretching his toes and repositioning his arms as the small talk from the kitchen ebbs and flows. A bird chirps, metronomically; I look for it; I find it in a tree; it darts away off across the pasture, yellow grass punctured by lattice transmission towers and grazing cattle. Beasley looks a lot like his owner, I think, as he sits there in my grandfather’s lap, long eyelashes and aged fur, an old dog resting on the leg of an old man. Occasionally, both of their eyes flick open, to assess their surroundings.<br />
<br />Bill Evans’ <em>Lucky To Be Me</em> plays, quietly. I usually set my headphones to be noise cancelling, but I think I should use transparency mode more often. I don’t need to block out the world around me all the time; I should not imply that my music is better than the people around me.</p>

      <h2><a href="/2024/12/25/What-Is-Stochastic-Drift.html">What is "Stochastic Drift"?</a></h2>
      <h3 id="xx1-introduction">xX.1 Introduction.</h3>
<p>I was inspired to make this today—well, yesterday by now—by <a href="https://knosmos.github.io/brownian/">a website</a> of my good friend, Jiereui Chang. Yes, the form—and title especially—are quite derivative. But I hope here I am able to create something unique of my own. Or at least something that justifies the silly amount of time I put into making this overly complicated LaTeX-themed Liquid template.<br />
<br /></p>
<h3 id="xx2-reasoning">xX.2 Reasoning.</h3>
<p><em>Stochastic Drift</em> in the context of physical systems refers to gradual and cumulative changes in a system over time due to probabilistic influences and noise. <br />
<br />In the same way, perhaps looking back upon this repository myself or others will be able to see the ways in which my mind drifts, and even rise above the peridically shifting trajectories and observe longitudinal trends. <br />
<br /></p>
<h3 id="xx3-goals">xX.3 Goals.</h3>
<p>I’m not sure it’s a good idea to place a fixed goal on how often I post here. That lack of direction should, I think, be embedded in its premise: that being that this site will be a variable accumulation that perhaps eventually amounts to a trend.</p>
