    <p><em>To the security guard, at the bag check at Firestone Library, whose name I should but likely will never know–</em></p>

<p><br />When you complimented my jacket today, with a genuine smile, a smile that says that this was a compliment not doled out like it was nothing, given instead from a place of geniune appreciation, I remembered. And I knew you did too.</p>

<p><br />I remembered when a few weeks ago you complimented my hair, and I remembered how we talked, for no more than fourty-five seconds, about how you “…don’t have the guts…” to grow it out like I did, after which I complimented your tatoos, which I could barely see, but which you took as quite geniune, and smiled that same smile from today, and then we said goodbye and I left.</p>

<p><br />And I knew today, retrospectively, as the knowledge smoldered and then burned, an inferno searing my back as I walked away and out the lobby doors, that you had expected me to have returned today’s compliment, at least somewhat, and that I had not, even though, had I taken a second more with my bag, I could have found something. And that it was a small, but geniune disappointment.</p>

<p><br />And as I listened to <em>Lucky To Be Me</em> on the way down the hill I resolved that should the opportunity present itself, I would have to make amends, in some manner.</p>

<p><br />How very similar we all are, yet how very separated we find ourselves.</p>
