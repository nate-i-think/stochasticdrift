<p>I think of the question “How should one best spend their life” as a sort of <em>NP-complete</em> problem, as a sort of prime mover question; that is to say, if it can be solved, we can derive the answer to every other important philosophical question using a reduction. Unfortunately, the answer to the prime question isn’t determinable, because it requires a universal perspective inaccessible to finite and subjective human understanding.</p>

<p><br />P ≠ NP. <em>Q.E.D.</em><br />
